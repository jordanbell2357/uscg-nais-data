[Maritime Mobile Service Identities - MMSI \| FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/maritime-mobile/ship-radio-stations/maritime-mobile)

> MMSI Numbers are:
>
> - Required to be programmed into radios with Digital Selective Calling (DSC) capability
> - Entered into AIS (Automatic Identification System) transceiver
> - Should be used for all INMARSAT B/C/M terminals
>
> The system is comprised of a series of nine (9) digits which are transmitted over the radio path to uniquely identify ship stations, ship earth stations, coast stations, coast earth stations and groups of stations. The first three digits of an MMSI indicate the issuing country.
>
> MMSI numbers may only be used for one vessel and may not be re-used, unless in the special case of a vessel transfer (please see the Vessel Transfer Tab).

> **International Vessel MMSI**
>
> All Vessel-formatted MMSI numbers supplied by the Commission will be in constructed in the following format in accordance with ITU regulations:
>
> M<sub>1</sub>I<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>X<sub>4</sub>X<sub>5</sub>X<sub>6</sub>X<sub>7</sub>X<sub>8</sub>X<sub>9</sub>
>
> Here, the first three digits are representative of the maritime identification digits (MID) which are indicative of the home country of the licensed vessel. The following digits from 4 to 9 will be any digit from 0 to 9. The Commission only issues MMSI numbers ending in 0 (zero). Should your MMSI number not end in this digit, and you wish to travel internationally, please acquire a suitable MMSI from the Commission, as numbers that do not meet this requirement are not accepted into the ITU database.

> **Domestic Vessel MMSI**
>
> For vessels that do not make international voyages or communicate with foreign ports, a domestic vessel MMSI number may be obtained and used. Similarly formatted to international MMSIs, these follow the M1I2D3X4X5X6X7X8X9 format as well. These MMSIs may not be used internationally and will end in a digit other than zero. They may be obtained from the Commission's MOU partners listed in the "Obtaining an MMSI" tab.
