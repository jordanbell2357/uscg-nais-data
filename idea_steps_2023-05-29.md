1. ~~Determine schema for loading daily AIS CSV files~~
2. Distribution of MMSI count
3. Choose an MMSI with a representative count
4. For one ship, do a time series plot of when messages exist
5. Ideally, there will be a natural break of message gap length
6. Some ships may turn of AIS when docked; can we use "AIS off" as a proxy for the ship not moving?
7. How much variation of SOG over trip: is it steady over the trip and then varies at end?
